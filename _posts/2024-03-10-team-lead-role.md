Because I can make EMEA Partner SE job the worst thing to do in the world

â€¦So it is what I consistently think, since i became the front line team lead. [From the excellent article I read at LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7177157849863630852/), the last part caught me Â« A good manager is the best gift you can give to an employee if you want them to have high job satisfaction Â», I realized I view it as flipped way; one may not choose the job just because of manager but one may leave because manager is the worst. I consistently reflect and tell self:

â€˜I know Iâ€™m not the best and itâ€™s fine - â€¦Letâ€™s just donâ€™t be the plagueðŸ’€Â´.

If I behave badly, it doesnâ€™t only affect myself now, it puts the team into the bad position. Because of some wrong sentences I say, because of some mistakenly forwarded emails I wrote, the team may lose valuable talent, the job satisfaction may badly hurt, and top talents may spend unnecessary emotional cost hurting productivity - that is heavy.

Hard for me to become the best leader ever of the world overnight, I donâ€™t even aim for it. I donâ€™t even know what it means to get into office politics (open and happy to start learning). Still, without taking serious responsibility and being considerate, i find it too easy to falling into being the worst. 

- By forgetting high performers energy is literally drained (because high performer chose not to tell me) & attempting to dump more work because they are strong
- By assigning work to talent that could be seen administrative & unproductive, (because it was needed to get sth done) without spending enough time to explain and getting buy in from the team then get misunderstood as if their work is less valued or theyâ€™re treated as my secretary 
- By dumping undesired work to close cross functional without enough thoughts, because I had sacred goodwill to protect my own team
- By being ignorant of great work done by silent and introvert top performers because people were too busy to tell me and they donâ€™t like posting in LI or phrasing self in the team meeting; then forgetting to appreciate enough of their contribution with excuse (how would I knowâ€¦?)
- By mistaking what is shareable and unsharable information then misunderstood to either way (you are distracting oversharer vs you are an un-sharing info hoarder) 

Scary to me - leaders mistakes, often done unintentionally but who cares, when it makes top talents suffer. it is easy to become one, especially in hierarchical set up then it takes a lot higher cost and bravery & risk taking needed to step up to tell leader Â« what you have done need to be rethought Â»

The only thing I could do as front line young (?) leader is to be explicit asking for feedback and tell people that itâ€™s not that i am only wanting to eat fully sugar coated French gourmet dessert from you; Iâ€™m actually trying to know things from your lens so i realize my blind spot. 

So no one hopefully need to unnecessarily suffer, top performers can continue to do their best work in the best possible productivity
