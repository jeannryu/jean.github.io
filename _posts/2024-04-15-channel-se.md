Dear Channel SEs, Partner SEs, ex-Channel Architects or Engineers whom I've never met - I'd love to connect & learn from each other. üßöüå≥

ü§î Who are you? 

- I am Jean. I work for Cloudflare Channel. I am a Partner SE.
- I live in Paris / France. I work with EMEA-based partners here.
- I lived in Singapore and Seoul (Ï∂òÏ≤ú as well). Experienced in the APAC market.
- I speak English and Korean. I also speak limited-level French & Japanese. (I used to be able to speak Chinese but too rusty). I love learning new things that expand my world. 

ü§î Why asking to connect?

Channel-partner-facing Solutions Engineer is a fascinating job, especially in saas tech that transforms from Product-led hyper growth to their next phases. I love the part of SE being a leader/owner of strategic long-term development of becoming business force-multipliers of each other via strong partnership. Like all the other jobs, this role has challenges as well. Gaps in how others see my role; assumed responsibilities (that may dilute my focus); the partner program, and necessary tools 'on the way' or 'emerging/evolving'; etc. That's fine because challenges are opportunities (and it's good to be in high demand role!). I want to be wiser in what I do every day, I'm very keen to learn from how the other fellow Channel SEs in the industry flip the challenges to positivity and kick the setbacks, achieving their goals. ü§ó Happy to tell my stories too if interested. 

üòáüëç How do you want to connect?

I hope my message bottle will reach somewhere!

If you are not a current / ex- channel SE and read this far... Thank you for being generous of your time! üôè I would deeply appreciate your help if you know someone who might be interested in connecting with me. üíù 

I am always keen on connecting with other Channel SEs. (independent of how old this post becomes)

Why did I post it?

Experiencing APAC then to EMEA market in Cloudflare, I will say I learn enough of the business's request and requirement to the Partner Solutions function. When you know the problem statement and analysed the gap, then you design the solution. But I wanted to make sure the solution is not isolated in the industry. Since this type of role exists outside of Cloudflare, if I think too much out of box and end up design something too uncommon, then the next thing is the new leaders from somewhere else in the industry might think it's "weird" then the team again faces the external assumption that we are not staffed to deliver. Long story short, to do an impactful work, but not in a weirdly isolated way. 

I received questions if I were seeking Partner SE opportunities outside of Cloudflare and if that was the intention. It's interesting that you may be always assumed by different perspective. I may, but not now. I love the team and want to do the right things for the team.
