# Weave your own global, private, virtual Zero Trust network on Cloudflare with WARP-to-WARP

| WARP has been Cloudflare's on-ramp, and will soon be able to be used as off-ramp (destination) too. With that you can support private to private traffic flow. Register your interest! [Waiting List](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/warp-peering/) [Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/warp-to-warp/) |

# Cloudflare is faster than Zscaler

| We‚Äôve run a series of tests comparing our Zero Trust services with Zscaler - Cloudflare Access vs ZPA, Cloudflare Gateway vs ZIA, and Cloudflare RBI [vs](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/miercom-report-cloudflare-vs-zscaler/) Zscaler Cloud Browser Isolation. We‚Äôve found that Cloudflare products are faster by 58% on SWG, by 38% on ZTNA, by 45% by Browser Isolation worldwide. [Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/network-performance-update-cio-edition/)  |

# Bring your own certificates to Cloudflare Gateway

| SWG certificates are important to apply traffic inspection to help protect against malicious activity and provide robust data protection controls to keep users safe. Cloudflare customers can bring their own certificate chain(new!) or continue to use Cloudflare issued certificates for this.

# Cloudflare DDoS threat report for 2022 Q4

| We realised a quarterly DDoS report which includes insights and trends about the DDoS threat landscape - as observed across Cloudflare‚Äôs global network. In the last quarter of the year, as billions around the world celebrated holidays and events such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, Black Friday, Singles‚Äô Day, and New Year, DDoS attacks persisted and even increased in size, frequency, and sophistication whilst attempting to disrupt our way of life.

# Cloudflare protection for all your cardinal directions

| As applications moved to the Internet and the cloud and users moved out of the office, clean definitions of north/south/east/west traffic used in the traditional perimeter security started to dissolve.  Traffic and data traditionally categorized as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù and guarded within the boundaries of the corporate perimeter is now commonly transferred over the Internet, and organizations are shifting to cloud-first security models such as SASE which redefine where security controls are enforced across that traffic. Cloudflare‚Äôs services can continue to be used to secure and accelerate all of your traffic flows, regardless of where you are today in your network modernisation journey.

# New ways to troubleshoot Cloudflare Access 'blocked' messages

| Cloudflare Access is the industry‚Äôs easiest Zero Trust access control solution. When you enforce least privilege rules at Access, it can sometimes lead to accidental blocks for legitimate users. To help your easier diagnosis of blocked requests, on top of existing tool for admin to evaluate their Access policy, we released a GraphQL API that allows administrators to look up a specific blocked request by RayID, User or Application.

# Announcing the Magic WAN Connector: the easiest on-ramp to your next generation network

| The first step to adopting SASE is getting connected ‚Äì establishing a secure path from your existing network to the closest location where Zero Trust security policies can be applied. We are announcing the Magic WAN Connector,  a new member to this family of on-ramps, it can be deployed in any physical or cloud network to provide automatic connectivity to the closest Cloudflare network location, leveraging your existing last mile Internet connectivity and removing the requirement for IT teams to manually configure network gear to get connected. We also added Cisco and SonicWall, joining previous partners Aruba, VMWare, and Arista as our hardware based on-ramp partnership.

# Announcing the Authorized Partner Service Delivery Track for Cloudflare One

| According to a recent report by iVanti, while 73% of companies plan to move to a cloud based architecture over the next 18 months, 46% of these companies IT security teams lack the confidence in their ability to apply a Zero Trust model on their own which is why 34% reportedly are relying on third party security providers to help them implement Zero Trust. For Cloudflare's prospective and current Cloudflare go-to-market channel partners, we are announcing new partner program that is designed to authorize partners that meet Cloudflare‚Äôs high standards for professional services delivery around Cloudflare One.
