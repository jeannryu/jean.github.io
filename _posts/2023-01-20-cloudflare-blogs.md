# Email Link Isolation: your safety net for the latest phishing attacks

| Cloudflare Email Security evaluates suspicious links in the email and takes the corresponding action - safe links open in the local browser as if they hadn‚Äôt been changed, while malicious links are prevented from opening altogether. The malicious links will be opened remotely in isolated environment and users will be protected! [Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/area1-eli-ga/) |

# Zone Versioning is now generally available

| I'm so happy that you do not need the [staging environment set up](/cloudflare/onboarding/2020/05/31/cloudflare-staging-environment.html) anymore, as now you can do it with zone versioning. Deploying at staging for sufficient tests, quick roll back to previous versions, now do it at version management! [Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zone-versioning-ga/) |
