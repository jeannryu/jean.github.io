Team Lead is a player-coach role with roughly 50% leadership tasks and 50% individual contributor tasks.

I’ve done Solutions Engineering Team Lead role 30 months at Cloudflare: 10 months in APAC, then 20 months in EMEA. Reflecting, there are some things I am proud of having spent time & energy for. There are some things that I would do differently. In the random order of popping up to mind, I want to document my learning journey. 

✍️ What would I do the same, even if I get a time turner?

💚 Care people. Action to care about them better.

💚 Admit that I’m not perfect. Explicitly ask for input/feedback.

💚 Make team priorities clear and understood.

I learned that when everyone is doing their best it just requires little spice to enhance the teamwork, communicate to make priorities clearer, collab smoother. When I took the TL role I wanted it as I was already proud of the team culture being active and positive. Esp great influential people on the team being explicit in appreciating to others. I was grateful, and started making my effort to keep it. I also tried to see who are rather silent and seek their input using the communication method they’d feel more comfortable - usually when people care, they have opinions. it’s just that everyone has different comfortable set up for communicating it out. I looked for constructive feedback and now have my collection of the (accepted feedback that I’d action on). These things are what I’d continue doing.

✍️ What would I do differently?

❤️‍🩹 - Be capable to control the level of my sensitivity.

❤️‍🩹 - Use actual criticism as visibility opportunities. Be positive to challenges.

❤️‍🩹 - Be less isolated, Connect more with others, diverse people. 

I still struggle with a lot of things including receiving an email « forwarding » with close-to-zero effort of explanation« Hey Jean can you help here? » …😤as if I am assumed of having time to read 115 emails in the thread and get myself up to speed, when I do not😤. Grrr. Truth is if I don’t want to be assumed of something, I need to communicate it out, thoughtfully. otherwise the result won’t change.

My view is that sensitivity is not necessarily bad as it enables me to notice signals earlier than it becomes a bigger problem (in Korean we call this skill « 눈치 ») however the TL experience gave me a lesson that I need to control / adjust the level of my blessed passive skill, so it serves the teams interest better. 

Many other stuff that i work on getting better, but now my TL time is over, new journey starts. I am not terribly worried. Because I am a blessed manager working with a great team, and also « Quand on connaît sa maladie, on est à moitié guéri » 😇🌸
