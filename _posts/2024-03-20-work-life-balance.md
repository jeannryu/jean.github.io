It's rather a privilege.

"In Asia -- For decades, we worked HARD to catch up with the world's more developed economies. Very hard." 

Agree or not - [this short comic resonates with me a lot](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7184396340292976641/). I live in a country where the labor right is probably the highest in the world - France. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· I'm expected to work about around 35hrs / week (France ë§Œì„¸!). I am originally from a country that is one of the well-known hard-working countries - Korea. ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Hard-working people in my home country needed to spend high cost to reach a social consensus to legislate the working hours of no more than 52hrs / week. I tilt my head if we in Korea did reach a real consensus about 52h/w - I discuss with my friends and ex-colleagues every now and then and I still experience a rainbow spectrum of opinions; some of those opinions I won't expect here in France. 
 
What I love about this comic is that it tells me it's not necessarily a right or wrong problem. Yes, it is obviously what helps your life, it is a privilege, it is a choice. It would be pretty hard for everyone in the world can keep their work and life balance and at the same time hyper-develop their economies like what I'm proud of from the (grand) parents generations. For those who start their career they may proudly choose to stay up at night or on the weekend, as their own choice, to hyper-develop their skills to meet their ambitious goal. It is something to be respected and admired, be clapped. 

What I am cautious about this comic is that as a leader I feel important to remember that while it is to be respected and admired - it is not to be a norm, at least a leader to believe so. (Leaders include influential team members and important cross-functional). I did the 60hrs/w early in my career, because I felt dumb, I wanted to fast-track everything, I wanted to bring some value to the table, then realized that I only had passion and time (not knowledge and experience). I was passionate about doing it, but I much more appreciated when my leader asked me to take it easy, rest more, rest, and recharge to be smarter. Honestly it was not appreciated when I heard "oh good work, since you work every weekend anyway - so can you do it another weekend since it's very important." Even if in the worst case we're in an organization or a team that is inevitable to work outside of good life balance, I feel a leader of a team would need to show their hardest try to keep the team's healthy balance - and I believe it leads to a better result and better productivity. I see this way, though I may be wrong. ðŸ™‚ (and I do protect max 52h/w in Korea, and hope the previous max 68h/w won't come back ever.)
