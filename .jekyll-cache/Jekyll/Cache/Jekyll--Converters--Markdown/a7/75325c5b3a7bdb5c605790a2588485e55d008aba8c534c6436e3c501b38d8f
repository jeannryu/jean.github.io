I"ç<p>Since June my French study is paused. My baby level French going rusty! I wanted to restart to study, so my new challenge for myself is to write any random things in French for 100 days, so I could use the words and exercise structuring sentences.</p>

<p>What I write may not make any sense as it‚Äôs just part of exercising. I‚Äôm literally using this blog as language practice notebook.</p>
