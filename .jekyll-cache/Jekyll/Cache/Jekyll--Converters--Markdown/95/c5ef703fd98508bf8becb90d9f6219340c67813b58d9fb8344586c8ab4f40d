I"	<p>Iâ€™ve filmed a Korean webinar on 21 May about <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/">Cloudflare Bot Management</a>. With this product, you can get a score info based on possibility of whether the particular request is coming from human through browsers, or from automated scripts, malicious bots. You can set your security rules based on this score. I was happy to have a chance to introduce this product as I personally like it. The product is available only for the enterprise customers.</p>
