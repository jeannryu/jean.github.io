I"[<p>This title is a christmas gift from my husband back in 2017. It’s a shame I’ve never played the game since then but working from home life and all the rules that gets stricter and stricter with time about going outside made me explore the game finally, and it was a brilliant idea. The game is extremely beautiful and well made.</p>

<p>The scenery in the game is awesome. While you can’t travel for fun or explore new forests or something, Zelda gives you temporary relief by its beautiful graphic…</p>

<p>The game is open world based so I can explore anything I’d like to do. Actually the game is all about what you want to do. It’s not like you have only one way to solve a problem you would face, instead you can think out of the box.</p>

<p>Horses you can discover and tame them and they’re lovely. It’s a shame that if they’re injured or damaged you can’t heal them. I wish I could.</p>

<p>My progress is not so much yet and it’s good because that means I have so much more to enjoy. Jérôme tells me it would take years for me to clear the game.</p>
